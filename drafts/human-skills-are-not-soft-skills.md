One of my biggest pet peeves is the description of skills like leadership, communication, and collaboration as "soft skills".

The word "soft" is used as a contrast to "hard" skills like software development, user interface design, or SEM marketing. And the connotation is often that these skills are less understandable, less teachable, and often also less valuable.

Bullshit.

### Human Skills

Instead of calling these skills "soft skills", I prefer a term I learned from [Ignacio "Nacho" Moreno](https://twitter.com/chonapuch):  Human skills.

These are skills that have to do with interacting with humans.

That means that to learn how to lead, you have to learn about people. To learn how to communicate, you have to learn about people. To learn how to collaborate, you have to learn about _people_.

Instead of "hard skills" and "soft skills" I prefer "technical skills" and "human skills".

Both may be equally "hard" to learn. Both can be equally based in science, models, or theories. Both are understandable, teachable, and valuable.

The primary difference is "technical" skills have to do with interacting with specific technologies or "things" in the world. And human skills have to do with interacting with people.

### Human Skills Are Valuable Everywhere

One other big difference between technical skills and human skills is that technical skills are often only valuable in particular situations, while human skills are valuable *everywhere*.

If you are a super skilled software developer, that is helpful to you in a work setting where there is a well-known need that can be solved well by software. It's not very useful in dealing with your significant other, or in volunteer work, or while you're traveling, or if you end up in a place where there aren't any software jobs.

On the other hand, if you're a super skilled communicator, that skill is valuable to you in _every_ environment. It will help you in your work as a software developer (or whatever else your specialization is), but it will also help you in your relationships, in volunteer work, on the road, and in any other job you might have to go into. 

Almost every situation you will ever find yourself in will involve humans. And in every one of those situations, your human skills will help you out.

### Learning About Humans

- How we are similar
  - cognitive limitations
  - needs

- How we are different
  - experiences
  - perspectives
  - goals
