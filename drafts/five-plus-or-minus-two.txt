One of the keys to effective communication is understanding the limitations of your audience.

Some limitations will be specific to a particular group or person, but there are some that are universal. One of the
most fundamental is the limit to short term memory.

Repeated studies have found this simple fact: A person can only hold around 5 things in their working memory at once.
There is some personal variation up or down, with some people able to hold only 3, and others as many as 7. So the rule
of thumb to remember is 5 +- 2.

## How we compensate for our memory limitations

Clearly we aren't limited to only ever considering five items in our life. So how do we compensate for the limitation f
five in working memory?

We organize. We group. We create categories and mental models that allow us to only consider subsets at a time.

Consider a quick shopping list:

* Oranges
* Deoderant
* Apples
* Meat
* Milk

The implications of this limitation are profound. If someone can only hold 5 things in working memory, that means that
