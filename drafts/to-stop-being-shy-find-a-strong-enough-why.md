I put myself out there a lot - giving talks at conferences, publishing newsletters, podcasting... to the extent that most people I talk with would never guess that I'm shy.

I'm good at "playing extrovert", to the extent that it's almost second nature at this point, but it hasn't always been the case. In fact it's something I've worked at _explicitly_ with intent since I was 13 years old.

### Why Work on Shyness

When I was a kid my shyness could be crippling. I could barely talk to someone I didn't know, especially if they were a girl. 

But I was interested in girls. Oh boy was I. I couldn't talk to them, but gosh I wanted to.

When I was in 7th grade, I managed to work up the will power to ask a girl to a dance. She said yes, and I was over the moon, but I also didn't know what to do.
