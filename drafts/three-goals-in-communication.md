There's a common trope that women communicate on many levels while guys communicate on only one.

To quote Jim Butcher, a Fantasy/Sci Fi author in one of his books:

> ...when women have a conversation, they're communicating on five levels. They follow the conversation that they're actually having, the conversation that is specifically being avoided, the tone being applied to the overt conversation, the buried conversation that is being covered only in subtext, and finally the other person's body language.
> .......When I, and most other people with a Y chromosome, have a conversation, we're having a conversation. Singular. We're paying attention to what is being said, considering that, and replying to it. All these other conversations have been going on for the last several thousand years? I didn't even know they existed...... I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.

Now this is overdone for effect.

It's certainly not purely a gender thing (though men _tend_ to be less aware of multiple layers of communication, and women _tend_ to be more aware). 

It's also not as static as this makes it out to be - not every conversation occurs on many levels, or on the same levels.

But what is true and important here is that there _are_ multiple possible layers to a conversation. And those layers are learnable. The more you learn about them, the more effective you'll be able to be in your conversations.

### Restricting to goals

For today's post, I want to talk in particular about three different types of outcomes or goals you might have in any particular communication.

For these goals, I'm going to extend on a model that was (to my knowledge) first created as a part of something called [Dialectical Behavior Therapy](https://www.verywellmind.com/dialectical-behavior-therapy-1067402) (DBT).

In DBT, they highlight that there are three potential goals in an interpersonal situation: Objective effectiveness, Relationship effectiveness, and Self Respect effectiveness.

Quoting from the [DBT Training Manual](https://www.amazon.com/DBT%C2%AE-Skills-Training-Manual-Second/dp/1462516998): 

Objective effectiveness "refers to attaining your objective or goal in a particular situation. Generally, the objective is the reason for the interaction in the first place"

Relationship effectiveness "refers to keeping or improving the relationship, while at the same time trying to achieve your goal in the interaction."

Self-respect effectiveness "is maintaining or improving your respect for yourself, and respecting your own values and beliefs, while you try to attain your objectives."

### The GPS Framework
I think this is a super powerful framework, but I like to use a slightly different framing to help me remember it and think about it in layman's terms.  I call it "GPS"
