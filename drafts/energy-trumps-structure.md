It's really easy when you start to geek out about speaking to try to do everything right.

Try to structure your talk perfectly, with the perfect intro, perfect outro, and everything in between.

Try to come up with exactly the right stories and jokes to tell.

Try to find the perfect cartoons to include that will not only show your point but also make everyone laugh.

I get it - I obsess over these things too, and I've definitely spent hours or even days looking for just the right supporting graphic.

But here's the thing - energy trumps structure every time.

### We are drawn to energy

We know that we perceive things wholistically, and that if we admire or are attracted to someone we are more likely to like what they have to say. This is the [halo effect](https://www.speakwritelisten.com/blog/10-2-the-halo-effect).

Here's another fairly universal thing about people: We're drawn to energy.

Charismatic leaders are almost always high-energy people. And when it comes to speaking, particularly on stage in front of an audience, energy communicates more powerfully than any story, joke, or graphic ever will.

### Embrace your own sense of joy

The best way to project that incredibly high energy is to speak about something that energizes you.

One of the most popular TED talks in history is [this talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?referrer=playlist-the_best_hans_rosling_talks_yo) by Hans Rosling on a set of data debunking myths about the developing world.

The talk is solid, and while the material would probably be interesting no matter who presented it, what makes this talk AMAZING is the energy than Professor Rosling brings to it.

You can _tell_ throughout that he absolutely loves what he's speaking about, and it brings him joy to share it.
