I used to struggle a lot when trying to communicate.

I'd try to explain something for five or ten minutes, only to watch the person I was talking to just get frustrated.

Or I'd work for hours on writing the perfect email, only to have the person I sent it to ignore it entirely.

I thought the problem was I didn't know the right words to say... but the reality was I didn't understand the people I was trying to communicate to.

### Effective communication is about how people perceive

Speaking is useless without a listener. Writing is useless without a reader.

Instead of studying language, I should have been studying people.
