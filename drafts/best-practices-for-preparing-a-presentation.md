I've had a couple of folks ask questions in the last week about how to prepare a presentation, whether it is for a meetup, a conference, or a business meeting.

Giving a presentation is a key skill in the working world, and speaking at a conference is a great thing to do. When you're a speaker, the conference should pay your way to the event, covering travel, board, and entrance.

Speaking in front of people can feel super intimidating, especially a large group like at a conference. And some of the nerves may never go away. Even famous performers like [Adele and Rhianna](https://songbirdsf.com/5-famous-singers-who-still-get-stage-fright/) state that they are still terrified every time they get in front of an audience.

That's okay. Those nerves are your body telling you that you care about the outcome. For most people, with practice the nerves get much better. And even if they don't, feeling nervous doesn't mean you can't rock your presentation.

But how do you prepare that talk in a way that sets yourself up for success?

I've prepared a set of best practices below to help you do just that. Don't feel like you have to do all of them to succeed! As one of my favorite teachers says, "You don't have to get it perfect, you just have to get it going". Instead use this as a resource to keep coming back to for improvement.

Without further ado, *here are 11 best practices for preparing a great presentation.*

## 1. Get clear on your message

Before you prepare much of anything else in your talk, you need to get clear on what the number one thing you want to get across is.

Are you trying to provoke action? Get the audience to do something? Inform them about a new possibility? Convince them of the right course of action?

One thing you should almost certainly *not* be doing is trying to teach them "all about" a subject. There is not enough time in a typical presentation to go super deep on anything. 

Additionally, the medium is poor for deep technical subjects. Instead, talks are best used to inform the audience *that* they should invest time learning a subject, and inspire them to do so.
If you are presenting a new tool or a new result, you'll want to communicate the high level concept and convince them it's interesting enough they should invest time and energy to learn more.

The clearer you are on what your talk is trying to accomplish, the easier it will be to put it together.

## 2. Craft your opening

It's almost cliche that you only have a limited time period to capture your audience's attention. Some folks say [7 seconds](https://www.andrewvorster.com/7-seconds/), others [30 seconds](https://www.presentationtraininginstitute.com/30-second-rule-grabbing-attention-first-30-seconds-crucial/), but there's wide agreement that you need to open strong.

Your goals are twofold: to provoke interest and establish rapport. You want your audience to like you, in order to trigger the [halo effect](https://www.speakwritelisten.com/blog/10-2-the-halo-effect). 

How to do it? There are multiple techniques.

You can tell a story that is relevant to the talk and the audience.

You can tell a joke (but make sure it is relevant to the audience; the goal is not a random joke but something that connects you to them). 

You can make a bold statement that perks their interest.

But whatever you decide, this part of your talk should be crafted very deliberately, and you should evaluate it with the questions: "Will this provoke interest in thee audience I'm speaking to?" and "Will this make the audience like or feel connected to me?"

## 3. Structure

While expert speakers can mix and match and weave complicated narrative structures, if you're giving one of your first few talks there's a fundamental structure you'll want to follow. [Jarrod Overson](https://twitter.com/jsoverson) put together a [great template](https://jarrodoverson.com/post/conference-talk-outline-43bc4c204f6e/) for how to structure a conference talk.

The structure you'll see below is very similar to this template, with more explanation as to why

#### Grab Attention

As discussed in point 2, your opening should be the most carefully crafted piece of your talk. Your goals are to grab attention and build rapport with the audience right away.

If you succeed in doing this, _everything else_ gets way easier. An audience who likes you and is intrigued is a responsive, easy audience.

#### Establish Context

After your opening grabs the audience's attention and begins to build rapport, you'll want to establish context. Set the scene for what you're going to be talking about by explaining the problem or situation it is addressing.

This should connect from the [audience's perspective](https://www.speakwritelisten.com/blog/10-3-perspective-is-priceless) so that they understand why what you're about to present is relevant to them. This is also a good place to include why you have some authority to talk to them about this subject.

#### Main Point & Talk Frame

Once you've established context, lay out the big picture key point for your talk. This is [leading with your conclusion](https://www.speakwritelisten.com/blog/10-11-start-with-your-conclusion), and it gives your audience a frame with which to listen to and evaluate the rest of your talk.

Don't worry if they don't agree with your conclusion yet - in fact, it should spark a question: "Why should that be true?". You will then answer this question in the body of your talk.

#### Three Key Sub-Points

The meat of your talk will live in three key sub points. These should each support your main point, and you should as much as possible explicitly tie them to that main point.

Each sub-point may contain it's own context - why you're bringing it up and why it's relevant, and may itself contain some sub-points (up to 3).

The number 3 is important here. Both because people have a [special reaction to groups of three](https://www.alivewithideas.com/blog/three-is-the-magic-number/), and because it keeps the number of things the audience has to consider at any time well within their [working memory limits](https://www.speakwritelisten.com/blog/10-1-seven-plus-or-minus-two).

If you need more than 3 supporting statements to get your key point, instead of having more sub-points, create a hierarchy, with a sub-point itself having new sub-points.

## 4 Outline your talk, don't write it out.

It's extremely tempting to try to write out your entire talk, especially if you're the type who likes to over prepare.  

I recommend against, for three reasons.

First is that the way that we speak is not the same way that we write. If you try to write out your talk, it will _sound_ like you wrote it, not like you're speaking.

Second, if you have your entire talk written out it will be very hard to resist actually reading it. And reading your talk will almost certainly sound stilted and low energy.

Third is that with a fully written talk, it's very hard to get back "on" if you get off.

Instead, outline your talk with key points you want to hit and reminders to yourself of stories you want to tell. 

## 5. Use minimalistic slides, and don't read them

Another common temptation when creating slides for a talk is to try to put a ton of information on them. Resist this temptation. 

If people are struggling to read your slides, they are not listening to you. The more content is on your slides, the harder it will be to keep your audience tuned in to you.

Your slides should accent and support your spoken words, not replace them. Use slides to illustrate a point, highlight a joke, or provide an anchoring word or phrase. But the key content in a _talk_ is what is spoken.

Along those lines, you should not be reading your slides. Nothing is more boring than a speaker reading out loud what the audience is reading in person. 

Your slides can restate, highlight, or accent what you are saying, but they should not _be_ what you are saying.

## 6. Embrace and cultivate your energy

## 8. Closing

## 9. Practice your talk out loud
