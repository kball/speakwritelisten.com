Welcome to SpeakWriteListen.com!

The goal of this website is to make you a better communicator. There is much more to come, but my premise is simple:

		* We all communicate
		* Better communication means better lives
		* Communication skills are learnable

  <h3>We all communicate</h3>
  <p>We text, we tweet, we gossip, we grunt, we yell, we beg. From the moment we're born, even before we learn to speak, we're communicating our thoughts and intentions.</p>
  <p>Communication is part of being human.</p>

  <p>But just because we call communicate doesn't mean communication is <i>easy</i>.</p>
  <p>Speaking, writing, and listening effectively is incredibly hard for most of us.</p>

  <p>Public speaking is the <a
  href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-real-story-risk/201211/the-thing-we-fear-more-death">number one
  fear in America</a>.

  <p>While <a href="https://www.iamselfpublishing.com/90-americans-want-to-write-a-book/">90% of people may claim they
  want to write a book</a>, <a
  href="http://sharonzink.com/writing-tips/97-of-writers-never-finish-their-novels-heres-why/">97% never
  finish</a>.</p>

  <p>This stuff is hard. But we all do it.</p>

  <h3>Better communication means better lives</h3>

  <p>Communication is key to healthy relationships, career advancement, and self-expression.</p>

  <p>Communication skills are consistently one of the <a href="https://www.thebalancecareers.com/top-skills-employers-want-2062481">top in-demand skills for
  employers</a>.</p>

  <p>On the flip side, communication issues (or <i>lack</i> of communication skills) are one of the <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/communication-success/201507/top-10-reasons-relationships-fail">top
  reasons for couples therapy and divorce</a>.</p>

  <h3>Communication skills are learnable</h3>

  <p>If you're not a natural communicator, you may feel like communication skills are a black box.</p>

  <p>Online articles about communication are usually filled with vague and generic advice, with little that is actionable.</p>

  <p>The <a
  href="https://garfinkleexecutivecoaching.com/articles/improve-your-communication-skills/9-tips-for-improving-your-communications-skills">top
  ranking article on Google</a> for the search term "improving your communication skills" at the time this site is starting contains
  advice like "Make communication a priority" and "Develop your listening skills, too".</p>

  <p>Sure, these things are great,
  but they're not very actionable. They're kind of like saying your key to getting in shape is to "make getting in shape a
  priority" and "develop your exercising skills too".</p>

  <p>This type of vague and general advice does learners a disservice. </p>

  <p>I believe communication skills are learnable, and our articles will be focused on giving you concrete things you
  can do to improve either your understanding or your skills.</p>

  <h3>This is a work in progress</h3>

  We're in very early stages, but I have big plans for this site. Come along and join me for the ride!
