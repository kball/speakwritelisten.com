    Hi, I'm Kevin Ball (alias <strong>KBall</strong>). I'm a software engineer turned trainer and coach focused on
    communication and leadership skill, and I started SpeakWriteListen.com because I was frustrated about the lack of
    practical, actionable resources for people interested in learning better communication skills.
  </p>
</div>
<p>
  These skills have been fundamental to my success in my career and relationships. Communication skills
  have been a key part of how I've been able to have a great career, travel all over the world speaking at
  conferences, publish a podcast, and celebrate over 20 years in a stable romantic relationship.
</p>
<p>
  With SpeakWriteListen.com, my goal is to share the lessons I've learned along the way, as well as new lessons I
  discover along the way. Through the articles, daily tips, and additional resources you will discover here you will
  be able to learn to speak better, write better, and listen better so that you can live a fuller, more empowered, and happier life.
